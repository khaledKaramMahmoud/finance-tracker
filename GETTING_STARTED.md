## 🎓 Learning the Code

### Start Here (Recommended Order)

1. **Models** (`src/app/core/models/`)
   - See TypeScript interfaces
   - Understand data structures

2. **Services** (`src/app/core/services/`)
   - Learn about Signals
   - See computed values
   - Understand business logic

3. **Guards** (`src/app/core/guards/auth.guard.ts`)
   - Route protection
   - Authentication checks

4. **Interceptor** (`src/app/core/interceptors/auth.interceptor.ts`)
   - HTTP request modification
   - Token injection

5. **Components** (`src/app/features/`)
   - Start with Login (simple)
   - Then Dashboard (complex)
   - Study filtering logic

6. **Routing** (`src/app/app.routes.ts`)
   - Lazy loading
   - Guard assignments

7. **Configuration** (`src/app/app.config.ts`)
   - Provider setup
   - App initialization

## 🔍 Key Concepts to Understand

### 1. Signals (Most Important!)
Look for these in services:
```typescript
signal()       // Create reactive state
computed()     // Derived values
effect()       // Side effects
```

### 2. Guards
See how routes are protected:
```typescript
canActivate: [authGuard]
```

### 3. Interceptors
Check how tokens are added:
```typescript
req.clone({ headers: ... })
```

### 4. Lazy Loading
Notice the imports:
```typescript
loadComponent: () => import(...)
```

### 5. Reactive Forms
Study form validation:
```typescript
FormBuilder, Validators, FormGroup
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use?
```bash
ng serve --port 4300
```

### Not Seeing Changes?
```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
# Clear cache
npm run build
# Restart
npm start
```

### Errors in Console?
- Check browser console (F12)
- Most likely just warnings
- App should still work

## 🎨 Customization Ideas

### Easy Changes
- Change colors in SCSS files
- Modify mock data in services
- Add new transaction categories
- Change currency symbols

### Medium Changes
- Add new budget periods
- Create custom validators
- Add more statistics
- Implement sorting

### Advanced Changes
- Add charts (Chart.js)
- Connect to real API
- Add data persistence
- Implement export feature

## 📱 Browser DevTools Tips

### Console Tab
- See signal updates logged
- Watch effects trigger
- Debug errors

### Network Tab
- See HTTP interceptor in action
- Check request headers
- Monitor API calls (mock)

### Elements Tab
- Inspect component structure
- Check applied styles
- Debug layout issues

### Performance Tab
- Measure load time
- Check bundle sizes
- Analyze rendering
